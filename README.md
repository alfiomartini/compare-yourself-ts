# Compare Yourself

This is a simple application comprising a frontend built using React and Typescript that communicates with a backend REST API developed using aws serverless computing tools. The REST API was defined using AWS API Gateway, and supports endpoints for posting, deleting and getting user's personal information concerning age, height and income. Each endpoint is bound to a specific lambda function written in Python. The definition of the API was inspired by a similar development originally written in Node.js by [Maximilian Schwartzm√ºller](https://academind.com/). Users information are stored in a simple table defined using the DynamoDB database, while API access is controlled by using Amazon Cognito user pools as authorizer.
